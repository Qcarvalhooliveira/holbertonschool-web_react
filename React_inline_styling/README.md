# **React inline styling** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* React inline styling refers to the practice of directly adding CSS styles to React components within the JSX code using a style attribute. This approach allows developers to apply styles directly to individual elements without using external CSS files. In React, inline styles are not written as a string but as an object with properties that correspond to CSS attributes. This method offers a high degree of control over the presentation of components, enabling specific styling changes to be made dynamically based on component state or props. However, it can lead to more verbose code and may impact performance if not managed properly, especially in larger applications where styles are frequently changed.
