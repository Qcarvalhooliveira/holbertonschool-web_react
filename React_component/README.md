# **React Component** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* A React component is a fundamental building block in the React library, which is used for building user interfaces. Components allow developers to break down the UI into reusable and independent pieces that can manage their own state and be rendered separately.

* The lifecycle of a Class component
