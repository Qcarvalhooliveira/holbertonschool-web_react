# **React props** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* React props, short for "properties," are a fundamental concept in the React library, used for building user interfaces. Props are how components in React communicate with each other. Essentially, they are parameters passed from a parent component to its child components. This allows child components to receive data from their parent, enabling dynamic content rendering and the reuse of components.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:
