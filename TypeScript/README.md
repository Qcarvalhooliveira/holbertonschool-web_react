# **Typescript** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft, first released in 2012. It is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid in TypeScript. The key feature of TypeScript is its optional static typing system, allowing developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, return values, and object properties. This helps detect errors during development, before the code is even run. Designed for building large applications, TypeScript transcompiles to JavaScript, enabling it to run in any browser or JavaScript environment like Node.js. Adding types improves code documentation, enhances autocompletion and refactoring in code editors and IDEs, and increases code readability and maintainability. TypeScript also supports modern JavaScript features (like ES6+) and introduces additional functionalities such as enums, interfaces, and generics.
