# **React state** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* React State is a built-in object used to manage and track dynamic data in a React component. It allows a component to create, read, update, and render changes over time. When state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated data. State is local to a component, meaning it cannot be directly accessed or modified by other components, promoting encapsulation and modularity in React applications. To manage state, you can use hooks like useState for functional components or the state property in class components.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* What the state of a component or a container is
* The lifecycle of a component
* How to modify a state and execute code in the right order
* What a controlled component is
* How to use Forms in React
* How to reuse smaller components, keep them pure, and lift its state to principal containers
* The use of a React Hook and how to create one
* How to test State changes with Enzyme

## **Tasks** :books:

#### **0. Adding a local state for notifications**

#### **1. Controlled components and state callback**

#### **2. Context**

#### **3. Context consumer & advanced state**

#### **4. Introduction to react hook**
