# **React Redux reducer+selector** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* In React Redux, a reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action as arguments and returns a new state, specifying how the application's state changes in response to actions. It handles state updates predictably and can be combined with other reducers in larger applications. A selector, on the other hand, is a function used to extract specific pieces of state from the store. Selectors encapsulate state selection logic, improve performance through memoization, and enhance reusability across different components, often utilizing libraries like Reselect for optimized state derivation.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* The purpose of a reducer and the role it plays within your application
* Why a reducer should stay as pure as possible
* Why mutations should not happen within a reducer
* The use of Immutable within the reducer
* The use of Normalizr within the app
* Selectors: what they are and when to use them
